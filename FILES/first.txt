Steganography is a fascinating technique that involves concealing information within other data, such as images, audio files, or text, in a way that is imperceptible to the human eye or ear. Unlike encryption, which secures information by making it unreadable, steganography hides the very existence of data, making it a powerful tool for covert communication and data protection. By embedding secret messages or files within seemingly innocent carriers, steganography allows individuals to share sensitive information discreetly, making it a valuable tool in various fields, including cybersecurity, digital forensics, and creative arts.
